INST377 Final Project-- Prince George's County Farmers Markets and the Goods They Sell

I used a [Prince George's County API](https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/resource/sphi-rwax.json) and dataset. The dataset was of farmer's markets in PG County in 2015.

My project shows the number of markets that sell different types of goods-- for example, how many of the farmer's markets sell wine, how many sell cheese, etc. The library I used was Charts.js. I did not use any CSS frameworks. My project is trying to display how frequently certain types of goods are sold.
